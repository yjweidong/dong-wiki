	  In general, create the following settings in the config file .ssh/config:

### Install OpenSSH on Windows Client (Optional):
	Some test cases, such as Device freeze, need to be executed remotely since the device will become frozen after applying DFZ request or be forced to reboot after unfreeze.
	Refer to https://winscp.net/eng/docs/guide_windows_openssh_server#installing_sftp_ssh_server for OpenSSH setup.
	Set and start sshd and ssh-agent services: Start type as automatic start and Log On as Local System account
	Start a SSH client (such as Mobaxterm) to run the test
